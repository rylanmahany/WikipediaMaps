WikipediaMaps a program that takes a Start wikipedia link. It will then browse all other links within the page for the Destination link.
If the destination is not found within the page, it will then search each link within the page in a Breath-First-Search.
The program will output a "path" from the Start link, followed by each succesive link, until the Destination link.
If a path is not found, the user will be notified that a path does not exist.
